# Muisc-Pal
If you want to figure out what genre of music, people in different age groups listen to, Music Pal is your "Pal"ðŸ˜‰

#The Research!

Studies show that as people get older their overal taste in music changes, while still keeping a sense of the old songs they listen to. This is why, you can go back and listen to the tunes you listened to years ago and still enjoy them!

A more specific study looks at the abundance of various genres of music in different age groups. While we can never strictly say that 16-20 years old begin their music journey with pop or Hip-Hop, there is an overwhelming number of teenagers who take this path. The reason is directly tied to the popularity of these types of music in the outside world so chances are if you attend an event of any kind, the music that's getting played is some type of Pop to attract the most amount of people they can.

#Data collected!

The csv file above is the database I used for the programm. As you can see this data set is incomplete, and it is upto the machine to predict the music taste of the person that is not collected! I have also embeded an score-accuracy file in the project which averaged a score of 90% on guessing the music taste of the user! 


#The algorithm!(The How!)

Jupyter notebook allowed me create a vs.code file which then translates to the process you see above!The programm brakes down the indexes entered by the user and creates a binary tree, in which each node has only two childs, and continues this process until it reaches an endpoint. After the program enters the propmt it starts searching in this binary tree 
and guesses the genre of music in  a matter of seconds!
